# Posting from iOS

To start, I needed a good markdown app for iPhone.  Apps like obsidian which are popular did not let me choose a folder to save my files.  A few other apps that did were costly. Then I found [Pretext](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pretext/id1347707000) which is a free app with no bells and whistles. It lets me choose a directory to save files in. Then I just need to start the file with the Hugo header for title time and draft.  As soon as I save the file it shows up on Hugo instantly. 

My next question is will **iOS Shortcuts** let me create posts and auto make the Hugo header. That would be cool. 

Nope. Pretext doesn't support shortcuts.
