# Starfield is awesome

*For now this is put with my other posts but once I learn tagging I'll tag accordingly.*

I am really loving this game. I feel bad for people who set unrealistic expectations and thought this game would be some game changing experience. No it's fallout in space and I love it.  I'm about 20 hours in and I haven't touched the main story in about 15 hours.  

I'll try to keep it spoiler free since I don't know how to hide spoilers yet lol.  This is likely going to be my GOTY.  

I'm really enjoying it. For it being a new IP it's been interesting cause with fallout the lore really sucked me in.  With Starfield idk much about the lore of the universe but there is much to learn. I got sucked into side quests and just learning the big players of different star systems. There's so much more for the lore to build it's going to be interesting to watch. Especially with some potential future DLC. 

Ugh pretext lost about half of this post and I don't feel like retyping it all out on my phone again. Prob user error but need to test and see if I can replicate before moving to a new app. I also made a little progress on getting silverbullet working with Hugo.
